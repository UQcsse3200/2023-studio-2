# **Description**
This should be roughly a one paragraph description of the features / ideas on which your team plans to work. It should very briefly touch on why you think it should be in the game (e.g. "Adds an extra layer of depth to game play"). It should also describe how it will appear or be used in the final product (e.g. "On starting a level, the game will generate a random, procedurally-generated map").

## SubFeature/component (optional)
If the ticket contains multiple components, you should explain them in more detail here.

## **Examples (optional)**
- **Part/Feature**: Depending on the ticket, you will often want to provide some examples of how it would play out in the game. See next point for example...
- **map seed**: maps can be generated from a "seed" where there may be different attributes, e.g. island, mainland, etc.
# **Dependencies**

List any features on which this ticket relies. If there is already an existing ticket, reference it using #xx. If a feature needs to be implemented and the issue does not already exist... make a new ticket and leave it unassigned for someone else to take on.

e.g. Random game mode relies on random map seed generation(#xx).
